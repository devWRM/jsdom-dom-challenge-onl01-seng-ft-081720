STEP 1      Incrementing Counter
    - Create a function that:
        -> Get the counter and set its innerText in a variable
        -> Increment the variable with ++
        -> Assign the counter's innerHTML to the incremented variable
    - Use setInterval to repeatedly call the function  every second to increment the counter by 1
    NOTE setTimeout (calls once) -vs- setInterval (calls repeatedly)

    NOTE Think of a function for incrementing the counter as a compact unit so the counter should be grabbed while INSIDE the function

    NOTE To change the ACTUAL web page, reassign the element's innerHTML or innerText

STEP 2      Decrement Button
    - Attach an event listener to the minus button that calls a function to decrement the counter
        Decrement Function:
        -> Get the counter and set its innerText in a variable
        -> Decrement the variable with -- (double minus)
        -> Re-assign the counter's innerText to the decremented variable

STEP 3      Increment Button  
    - Attach an event listener to the plus button that calls a function to increment the counter
        Increment Function:
        -> Get the counter and set its innerText in a variable
        -> Increment the variable with ++
        -> Re-assign the counter's innerText to the incremented variable
